# Overview 
Christy runs a pet grooming company, and I have been helping her to digitalize her work. She has several registered customers with multiple pets and a huge staff and inventory. Here are the class and sequence diagrams which I designed to develop software for her business. Along with the basic user creation and appointment generation feature, I have added some additional functionalities with detailed use cases.
